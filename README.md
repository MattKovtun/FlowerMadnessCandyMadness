# FlowerMadnessCandyMadness
Practice classes are done by Matvii Kovtun

*****************************************
Description: 
  Inside of the src folder there are 2 folders each of the either first of second part of hometask.
Structure of the classes in folders is identical, therefore documantation is written only for package CandyMadness. 
I didn't see any reason to write same documantation in 2 documents. 
*****************************************

Manual on Usage:
  As I mentioned before each of the packages has the same structure, parent abstract class Candy or Flower, 2-3 child classes,
and one ---Main file. For proper usage, one can open ---Main file, and see tests of functions.
Programm provides following actions:
  1) add flower/candy to box/bucket.
  2) sort flowers/candies by its attribute. (all sorts are just manually rewritten insertion sort)
  3) print flowers/candies from box/bucket.
